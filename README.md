# reverseString
UtopiaCompressionAssessment-different methods to reverse a string

## used both Python and C++ to realize the string reverse function
---
### inPython contains the python files as scripts
Five methods can be run differently using "python3 reverse#.py", each can take a string as input and print the reversed string out.

### inCpp contains a main file to excute all the functions
Five methods can be called in main.cpp where a headfile includes the other methods.
The main.cpp takes five input strings one by one and output the reversed string
